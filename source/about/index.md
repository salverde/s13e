## About
My name is Salomon and I’m a Software Developer, creator, and tinkerer. I’m currently working at ... as a Software Developer, where I work on anything from writing documentation, building developer tools, automating continuous integration pipelines, and optimize API endpoints for various clients both mobile and other.

My greatest desire is to help build technologies that empower people who would otherwise be powerless, whether it's financial systems, information privacy, or democratizing software.

Here's some more info about me:

- Currently in Albuquerque, NM
- Pastimes include enjoying making sound effects, spending time with my wife and kiddos, and tinkering with sound pedal hardware
- Taught myself guitar repair and lutherie craftsmanship. I enjoy crafting on all things guitar and amplification of sound
- Lastly, I am an audiophile at heart and can appreciate the best sounding earbud, headphone, and home audio system

Feel free to reach out!
