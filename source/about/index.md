## About
Hey there! My name is Salomon and I’m a Software Developer, creator, and tinkerer. I’m currently working at ... as a DevRel, where I work on anything from writing documentation, building developer tools, to writing blog posts, and filming videos. I'm also working on Orbiter, a new approach and open approach to app hosting. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem. Ut enim aeque doleamus animo, cum corpore dolemus, fieri tamen permagna accessio potest, si aliquod aeternum et infinitum impendere malum nobis.

My greatest desire is to help build technologies that empower people who would otherwise be powerless, whether it's financial systems, information privacy, or democratizing software.
