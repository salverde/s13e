## About
My name is Salomon and I’m a Software Developer, creator, and tinkerer. I’m currently working at Pixel Coders Tech. as a Software Developer, where I work on anything from writing documentation, building developer tools, automating continuous integration pipelines, and optimize API endpoints for various clients both mobile and other.

I sometimes describe myself as an Entire Stack Developer given the fact that I've worked professionally and personally on most of the stacks or teams a software shop has. Naturally I started out doing Web Apps during the ColdFusion /J2EE days building out Rich Internet Applications (RIAs), then organically moved over to Mobile Applications and completely saturated myself in the Apple iOS SDK ecosystem. At that time I had built several native mobile apps for iDevices mostly for b2b.
After my mobile dev interests ran its course (or rather Apple became Apple), I coincidentally jumped into the DevOps / Infrastructure as Code world and began my hacks and recipes writing and deploying scripts using Chef and Ansible. I learned a lot in a short amount of time as I was able to manage, automate and deploy hundreds of nodes at an enterprise level in the Gov't contracting space for xyz and DoD. Can't say much on these projects but one could imagine the level of infrastructure needed to manage our nations GPS satellites.
So throughout all these different verticals in the stack I was always working on the web/app servers delivering up content or consuming via some sort of API service.


Here's some more info about me:

- Currently in Albuquerque, NM
- Pastimes include enjoying making sound effects, spending time with my wife and kiddos, and tinkering with sound pedal hardware
- Taught myself guitar repair and lutherie craftsmanship. I enjoy crafting on all things guitar and amplification of sound
- Lastly, I am an audiophile at heart and can appreciate the best sounding earbud, headphone, and home audio system
