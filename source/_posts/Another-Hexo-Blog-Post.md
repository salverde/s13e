## Some Thoughts

- So this is another post that was created via Obsidian. Which is quite the killer little tool when it comes to markdown. It has several plugins allowing you to write any sort of scripts around your notes. It's basically like excel and dba but instead of spreadsheets (which you can do to) its markdown flavored notes and pages. Im currently writing a little script that will generate a random lyric (sourced from data files). All this is done via `dataviewjs` plugin in Obsidian...
- Although Obsidian did just release their Base feature, so I did start to play around with that as a source truth for these lyrics. I just need to figure how to store this data.
