### What is /uses?
Check out {%link "uses.tech" https://uses.tech %} for a list of everyone's /uses pages

I change specs of my setup fairly often (always open to trying new things) so this page will serve as a living document and a place to point curious developers to when I get asked.

## Editors/Terminals

- My current text editor is (Neo)Vim. This is my current neovim Linux and Windows configurations.
- About my theme, I switch frequently from Gruvbox and One Vim. But my current favorite theme is Catppuccin.
- I used DroidSansMono Nerd Font Mono font for years, but around 2022 I switched to Iosevka font.
- My development browser is the beloved Firefox Dev Edition and my current personal browser is Brave.
- For my other work that doesn't concern dev, I use Chrome.
- For my terminal, I'm currently using Wezterm with WSL Ubuntu 20.04 LTS inside a nested TMUX. I used Mintty and then Windows Terminal but Wezterm has a more minimalistic look. If you are curious, here is my Wezterm config.
- If you are interested in my other configs such as zshrc, bashrc, gitconfig, you can check my Ubuntu, Windows and Arch Linux dotfile repositories. Please keep in mind that my configs are personal and opinionated, although they work for me, they might not be the best for you.
